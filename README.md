# 🎓 Autonomous Learning Agent  
## Designing an Autonomous Learning Agent with Checkpoint Verification and Feynman Pedagogy

An AI-powered autonomous learning system that delivers **structured, adaptive education** through **checkpoint-based verification**, **intelligent evaluation**, and **Feynman-style simplified explanations**.

---

## 🌟 Overview

The **Autonomous Learning Agent** is an intelligent tutoring system designed to ensure **true understanding before progression**.  
Instead of allowing learners to move forward based on completion alone, the system **verifies conceptual mastery at each checkpoint**.

When insufficient understanding is detected, the agent automatically applies the **Feynman Teaching Technique**, providing simplified explanations and enabling adaptive re-assessment.

This project demonstrates how **agentic AI workflows** can be applied to education for **mastery-driven, personalized learning**.

## 🎯 Project Objectives

- Enforce **checkpoint-based mastery learning**
- Automatically evaluate learner understanding
- Provide **adaptive explanations** using Feynman pedagogy
- Enable autonomous decision-making in learning workflows
- Reduce superficial progression and improve concept clarity

---

## ✨ Key Features

### 🧠 Core Learning Capabilities
- 📍 **Checkpoint-Based Learning**  
  Learning is divided into structured checkpoints that must be cleared sequentially.

- 🤖 **Autonomous Evaluation Agent**  
  Learner responses are evaluated automatically using LLM-based reasoning.

- 📊 **Understanding Threshold Enforcement**  
  A minimum score of **70%** is required to pass each checkpoint.

- 💡 **Feynman Teaching Trigger**  
  If the score is below the threshold, the system generates simplified explanations using analogies and step-by-step reasoning.

- 🔁 **Adaptive Retry Mechanism**  
  Learners reattempt assessments after receiving simplified explanations.

---

### 🚀 Intelligent System Behavior
- Objective-aligned question generation  
- Concept gap identification  
- Iterative learning until mastery  
- Autonomous flow control without manual intervention

## 🧩 Architectural Explanation

### 🔹 Autonomous Workflow Engine
The system follows an **agent-driven workflow**, where each stage dynamically determines the next step based on learner performance.

### 🔹 Feynman Pedagogy Logic
When understanding is insufficient:
- Concepts are explained using **simple language**
- Analogies and real-world examples are provided
- Emphasis is placed on *why* rather than memorization
