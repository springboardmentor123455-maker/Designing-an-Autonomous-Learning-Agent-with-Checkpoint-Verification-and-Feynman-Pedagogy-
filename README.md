# 🎓 Autonomous Learning Agent  
### Designing an Autonomous Learning Agent with Checkpoint Verification and Feynman Pedagogy

An AI-powered autonomous learning system that delivers **structured, adaptive education** through **checkpoint-based assessment**, **intelligent evaluation**, and **Feynman-style simplified teaching**.

---

## 🌟 Overview

The **Autonomous Learning Agent** is designed to simulate an intelligent tutor that not only teaches content but also **verifies learner understanding before allowing progression**.  
The system dynamically evaluates learner responses, identifies weak concepts, and automatically triggers **simplified explanations using the Feynman Technique** to reinforce learning.

This project emphasizes **learning verification, adaptability, and autonomous decision-making**, making it suitable for intelligent tutoring and personalized education scenarios.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Ensure **concept mastery** before progression
- Provide **adaptive explanations** when learner understanding is low
- Automate learning workflows using agent-based logic
- Implement structured, checkpoint-driven learning paths

## ✨ Key Features

### 🧠 Core Functionality
- 📍 **Checkpoint-Based Learning**  
  Learning content is divided into structured checkpoints that must be cleared sequentially.

- 🤖 **Autonomous Evaluation Agent**  
  Learner answers are evaluated automatically using LLM-based reasoning.

- 📊 **Understanding Threshold Enforcement**  
  A minimum score of **70%** is required to pass each checkpoint.

- 💡 **Feynman Pedagogy Integration**  
  When a learner fails, the system generates simplified explanations using analogies and step-by-step breakdowns.

- 🔁 **Adaptive Retry Mechanism**  
  Learners are reassessed after receiving simplified explanations.
