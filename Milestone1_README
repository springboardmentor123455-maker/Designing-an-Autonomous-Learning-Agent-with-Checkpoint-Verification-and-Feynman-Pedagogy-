## Executive Summary
The **Autonomous Learning Agent** is a next-generation AI tutoring system designed to solve the "Hallucination" and "Lack of Structure" problems in self-directed learning. Unlike standard chatbots that simply generate text, this agent operates as a **Stateful Intelligent System**. It follows a rigorous pedagogical workflow: researching, verifying, grading, and correcting its own work before presenting it to the learner.

Built on **LangGraph**, the system implements a **Hybrid RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)** pipeline. It intelligently switches between local user notes and autonomous web research to provide the most accurate, cited answers possible.

## The Problem It Solves
Self-learning complex technical topics (like Deep Learning or Quantum Computing) is difficult for two reasons:
1.  **Information Overload:** Searching the web yields too many results, many of which are irrelevant.
2.  **Lack of Verification:** When asking standard AIs for help, they often "hallucinate" (invent facts) or give shallow answers without sources.

**This Agent's Solution:** A "Glass Box" architecture that forces the AI to **cite its sources** and **grade its own accuracy** using a secondary intelligence layer.

## System Architecture

The agent functions as a cyclical graph workflow rather than a linear chain. It maintains a memory of its current "state" (Topic, Context, Retries) and moves between nodes based on logic.
