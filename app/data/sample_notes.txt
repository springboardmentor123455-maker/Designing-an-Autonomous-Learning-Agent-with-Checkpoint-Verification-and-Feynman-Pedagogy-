Supervised learning is a type of machine learning where the model is trained using labeled data.
Each data point has input features and a known label or target.

Logistic regression is a supervised learning algorithm used mainly for binary classification.
It uses the sigmoid function to map any real value into a probability between 0 and 1.

Accuracy measures the fraction of correct predictions.
Precision measures how many predicted positives are actually positive.
Recall measures how many actual positives were correctly predicted.
The F1-score is the harmonic mean of precision and recall.
